Alright, I know what you're thinking, you made a fake game website like the other ones-\
**Nope!**\
This isn't like any ordinary game website, this one is *open-source*, which means you can view the full website code! And if you're skilled enough, maybe make some pull requests to contribute, here's the [project link](https://github.com/FreeGamesOnline-ee/freegamesonline-ee.github.io).

## How? (When)
I **pushed** the first ever commit to the repository 2 weeks ago (i can't get the actual date/time), this doesn't really count, since the first commit is actually [this one](https://github.com/FreeGamesOnline-ee/freegamesonline-ee.github.io/commit/77e0a19cb40983ff5184b9678e1de8a2e86a5d65), it's the first one that actually had code.\
You might ask, where you alone?\
And to that I say, **yes**, but after a few days, a friend with the GitHub Username of [@RTX3080Ti-Official](https://github.com/RTX3080Ti-Official) joined the [@FreeGamesOnline-ee organization](https://github.com/FreeGamesOnline-ee).
